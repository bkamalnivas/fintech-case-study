### Robinhood Markets case study (HOOD) ###

- A small startup that offered commision free trading to various assets.
This has forced very other competitor to follow suit & make trading commision free.
Even for the basic trader, they make after hours trading, options & fractional shares & crypto currency accessible.

- Till they came along, no one had envisioned trading from their mobile phones.
Their UI is extremely simple & fluid. Even, the rest of the big banks have not been able to emulate them.

- Thier strengths are also their weaknesses. Making the trading commission free comes at a cost.'
There is lack of transparency in their order flow which is also their primary source of revenue.
Lack of useful resources on the company that their investors invest makes it challenging for new
investors.

- Robinhood growth might be steady but not exponential in the coming days. Their competitors are ever growing.
It is not just the big banks, smaller companies like Sofi are thier latest competitors.
Their success largely depends on reatining the new customers & the growth of their average account balance.
